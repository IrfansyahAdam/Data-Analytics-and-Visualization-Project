# Project Analysis of Temperature Change Trends Based on BMKG Daily Climate Data with Linear Regression Method on Python
This study aims to analyze the trend of Indonesia's temperature change based on daily climate data obtained from BMKG. Time series method and linear regression model method and linear regression model are used to identify the pattern of temperature change in 2024. Using Python (libraries Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scipy, Cartopy, and Sklearn) and BMKG daily climate dataset, the data was processed and analyzed computationally. The results showed a downward trend in temperature in the last 6 months since the study began.
