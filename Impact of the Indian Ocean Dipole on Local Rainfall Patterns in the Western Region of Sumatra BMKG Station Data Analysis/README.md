# The Impact of Indian Ocean Dipole (Iod) on Local Rainfall Patterns in the Western Sumatra Region: BMKG Station Data Analysis (Case Study: Year 2023)
This study analyzes rainfall data from 10 observation stations in North Sumatra, West Sumatra, and Riau. A linear regression method was used to understand the relationship between the IOD phases and rainfall distribution. The results show that during the positive IOD phase (August–October 2023), rainfall increased significantly, while the negative phase (January–May 2023) was associated with a decrease in rainfall. Moreover, the observed rainfall patterns also indicated local anomalies that do not fully align with the generally stable equatorial distribution theory. These findings provide important insights for hydrometeorological risk management in western Sumatra, particularly in facing climate change and regional climate variability.
